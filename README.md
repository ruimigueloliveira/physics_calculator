Two languages were proposed, one for a compiler and the other for reading structured information. In this way, it would be necessary to define the syntax and semantics of a program language, implement the respective analyzes in ANTLR4, define the semantic rules of the language, create sample programs and define the code generation standards for the language instructions. Thus, we intend to have a well-expressed and simple language, adapted grammars, semantic analysis, correct and manage errors, readable code writing and finally code generation. The theme chosen by our group was a language for dimensional (physical) analysis. So it would be necessary to define variables, iterative instructions, expressions.
